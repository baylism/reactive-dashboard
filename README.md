# reactive-dashboard 

A basic dashboard using Spring WebFlux and React.

This is a work in progress:

## TODO
- [x] Set up development environment. 
- [x] Create a single-page react application with a line graph component that can be updated as new data is streamed in. 
- [x] Create a Spring WebFlux backend and that serves the React application. 
- [x] Create some sample data streams (probably random numbers) which will be displayed on the dashboard. 
- [x] Create a Webflux websockets API to which the clients can subscribe. 
- [x] Publish the data streams on the API and visualise in the react graphs.
- [ ] More components for different graph types (bar, doughnut etc.)
- [ ] Build out React app with better structure, error handling etc.
- [ ] Improve CSS
- [ ] Add Spring security, optimise backend (connection sharing?)
